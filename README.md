# Postikiisu
Chrome extension that replaces all images at *.postimees.ee with pictures of cats.

This is a quickly thrown together proof-of-concept at this stage. Not all images are replaced (galleries are not altered), replacing is dead-slow and broken image links aren't handled. Feel free to address any of these issues and submit a pull request.

It's only tested together with uBlock Origin. Without an adblocker it'll probably screw up the page layout in random places..
